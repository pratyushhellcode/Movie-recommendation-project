# Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This Movie Recommendation System provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze movie data and recommend films tailored to individual tastes.

## 🚀 Features
- **Content-Based Filtering** – Recommends movies similar to those a user likes.
- **Collaborative Filtering** – Suggests movies based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Hybrid Model** – Combines both approaches for enhanced recommendations.
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Easy-to-use Jupyter Notebook with clear visualizations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
- IMDb/TMDb Dataset (Movie Data)
